#Home Inspector Application

##Application intent
The homes we live in are some of the most fundemental parts of everyone's day to day life in the United States.
The places we live are a key factor in some of the most basic elements of our lives down to the water we drink, 
the air we breathe, people and community we can engage with. Most similar applications avaialable only concern
themselves with the immediate financials consideration around a peice of real-estate. While this financials 
information is still important, it fails to take into account of the myriad of other important factors that 
potential tennant out to concern themselves with when choosing where to live.

The goal of Home Inspector is to put the important information beyond just the financials of a given property
directly at the user's fingertips. Home Inspector takes information from sources like the EPA to give the user
access to the other risks a particular residence might pose to them beyond just the risk to thier wallet.

##Application Requirements
Home Inspector is currently only available on Android and requires that the device is operating on Android 7.1  
Nougat (API level 25) or greater. Attempting to use earlier version of the Android Operating system may lead to
compatability issues and unexpected crashes.
