        \nExcept as otherwise provided herein, each party expressly undertakes to retain in confidence all information and know-how transmitted or disclosed to the other that the disclosing party has identified as being proprietary and/or confidential or that, by the nature of the circumstances surrounding the disclosure, ought in good faith to be treated as proprietary and/or confidential, and expressly undertakes to make no use of such information and know-how except under the terms and during the existence of this Agreement.

        \nThis Agreement shall constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous communications regarding the subject matter hereof.

        \n\n<b>17. Severability</b>

        \n\n<b>18. Force Majeure</b>
        \nNeither party shall be deemed in default of this Agreement if failure or delay in performance is caused by an act of God, fire, flood, severe weather conditions, material shortage or unavailability of transportation, government ordinance, laws, regulations or restrictions, war or civil disorder, or any other cause beyond the reasonable control of such party.
